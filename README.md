# EXODIA MAGE (updated for Knights of the Frozen Throne)

## Intro

To build a great quest mage, you need the following four components:

1. Quest Items
2. Win Condition
3. Survivability
4. Card Draw

## Quest Items
So for quest items, we want to generate the cheapest spells that are easiest to cast. We want to be able to do this reliably. 
These are all the options in Standard:

|                          | Cost to Generate                  | Cost to Cast   | Spells Generated | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Analysis
In trying to rank these options, we should prioritize low variability, to make an inconsistent deck MORE consistent. The less RNG we have to rely on the better. So Discover > Add.
The second priority is cost, we want cheap spells that can be cast easily, and don't have negative side effects for us.
So, it is pretty clear that we can rule out some of these right away.
Here is how I would rank them:
- Primordial Glyph
- Mana Bind
- Ghastly Conjurer
- Cabalist Tome
- Burgly Bully
- Kabal Courier
- Mukla
- Babbling Book
- Shimmering Tempest
- Kabal Chemist

The rest are not really worth considering. 

So, I would suggest, that we take 2 Cabalist Tomes (6 spells), 2 Primordial Glyps (minimum of 2 spells), and 2 Kabal Courier's. 
This should give us, at least 8 spells to play (if the Couriers whiff) and it is pretty likely that at least 6 of them will be playable. Note, Mukla is a good option to replace the courier's but I would not craft it just for this deck. 

## Win Conditions

The win conditions are primarily concerned with finding an OTK. The one advantage that this deck has over freeze mage, is that you can't heal out of range of it, you can't gain armor to avoid the burn. That is why I will focus on the Archmage Antonides and the 4 Sorceror's Apprentices strategy, known as Exodia.

So, to set up this win condition, we need 
1. Open the Waygate
2. Archmage Antonides
3. 2x Molten Reflection
4. 2x Sorceror's Apprentice

So this package of 6 cards is all we need for this section. 


## Survivability
To last long enough to get our combo ready, we need to survive, so we basically are going to take the tried and true freeze mage strategy. 
- 2x Frost Nova
- 2x Doomsayer
- 2x Blizzard
- 2x IceBlock
- 1x Frost Lich Jaina (I run this instead of ice barrier, because it gives you armor and usually around 3 heal)
- 2x Arcanologist

This is the core of the freeze mage package, you can potentially cut one of the Ice Barriers or add some Cone of Cold's.

## Card Draw
This is also pretty standard

- 2x Arcane Intellect
- 2x Coldlight Oracle
- 2x Novice Engineer

The reason that I do not like to have Acolyte of Pain is because it is pretty mana inefficient to ping him for draw, and you can also help your opponent to mill a crucial combo piece. This should never happen. The focus of this deck is to control all the variables we can, so that we can be consistent. 

General Notes:
I don't like alexstraza, because it tends to clutter up your hand.
